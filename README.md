# Individual Python Tasks
This repository contains solved tasks with using Python3 language.

# File includes
**Directroy "models"** contains modules that using in any script, that make code more readable and help to don't repeat yourself.

**Root directory** contains scripts within solved tasks.

**Chessboard** - program displays a chessboard with given demensions parameters of width and height.

**Number to text** - program convert inputted digits to a text representation: 12 - twelve.

**Happy tickets** - There are 2 ways to count lucky tickets:
+ Simple - if a six-digit number is printed on the ticket, and the sum of the first three digits is equal to
the sum of the last three, then this ticket is considered happy.
+ Complicated - if the sum of the even numbers of the ticket is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of the ticket, then the ticket
considered happy.
The program determines which option to count lucky tickets will give them more quantity at a given interval.
Input parameters: min and max ticket number
Exit: information about the winning method and the number of lucky tickets for each counting method.

**Numeric Sequences** - program displays a comma-separated row of length n, consisting of natural numbers, the square of which is not
less than given m.

**Fibonacci** - program displays all Fibonacci numbers that satisfy the constraint passed to the function:
are in the specified range, or have the specified length.

**Palindrome** - program checks if a string or number or part of it is a palindrome. For example, the number 1234437 is not
palindrome, but palindrome is part of 3443. Numbers less than 10 are not palindrome think.

**Envelope analysis** - there are two envelopes with sides (a, b) and (c, d) to determine whether one envelope can be inserted into
other. The program must handle the input of floating-point numbers. The program asks user envelope sizes one parameter at a time. 
After each counting program asks the user if he wants to continue. If the user answers “y” or “yes” (without register), 
the program continues to work first, otherwise - completes performance.

**Triangle** - Create a console program that performs the output of triangles in descending order. their area.
After adding each new triangle, the program asks if user add one more.
If the user answers “y” or “yes” (case insensitive),the program will ask you to enter data for another triangle, otherwise it displays result in the console.
the calculation of the area of a triangle should be set using the Heron formula;
input format (comma separated): , <side_1>, <side_2>, <side_3>;an application must handle floating point numbers.

**File parser** - The program has two modes:
1. Reads the number of occurrences of a string in a text file.
2. Makes the replacement of a string for another in the specified file
The program accepts input arguments at startup:
+ file path; line to count.
+ file path; string to search; string to replace.

# Run scripts
To run scripts you just need to install python3 interpreter on your computer from https://www.python.org. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions. Mac OSX distributions from 10.3 (Panther) and up include a version of Python, which may be suitable for beginning despite being as much as two years out of date. Linux distributions also frequently include Python, which is readily upgraded.
